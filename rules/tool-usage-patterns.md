# Tool usage patterns

By default, implement changes with the editor and bash tools instead of just suggesting them. If my intent is unclear, choose the most useful action and proceed.

## Tool usage & triggering

Use this tool when it's clearly helpful, and let claude decide.

When reading multiple independent files or running unlrelated commands, call those tools in parallel. Only run them sequentially if one depends on the output of another.
